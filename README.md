This model was designed to simulate, analyse and evaluate the activities within an eco-industrial park to generate insights on how profit distribution takes place in the presence of contractual agreements between industrial agents. The model also studies the resulting effects of varying inflationary factor and the reliabilities of various industrial agents within the eco-industrial park.
